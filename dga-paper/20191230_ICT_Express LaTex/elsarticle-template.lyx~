\begin_layout Abstract
An important techniques adopted by cyber attacker is use of Domain Generation
 Algorithms to generate arbitrary domain names for their Command & Control
 servers.
 Algorithmically generated domain names are hard to detect and hence machine
 learning based classifiers are used for this task.
 However, domain generation algorithms are now relying on dictionary wordlist
 based domain names.
 These names are difficult to detect even by most sophisticated machine
 learning classifiers.
 We propose a malicious domain detection and classification model based
 on Transformer neural network architecture that outperforms state of the
 art methods currently found in literature by many percentage points.

 Malware such as ransomware once infected need to communicate their respective
 Command & Control (C&C) server.
 To reach out to C&C, malwares rely on domain names generated using Domain
 Generation Algorithm (DGA).
 As shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:DGA-Workflow"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 ,attackers registers Algorithmically Generated Domain (AGD) names.
 Once infected, malware tries to contact AGD.
 On successful communication either malware leaks data to C&C server or
 further infects other hosts in victim's network.
 In case of ransomware attacks malware encrypts victim's data.

\begin_layout Standard
For obvious security reasons security administrators tries to blacklist
 malicious domain names used by malware.
 Malicious domain names could be gibberish such as 
\emph on
ocufxskoiegqvv.com
\emph default
.
 Large number of such requests may not resolve due to absence of NXDomain
 records.
 However, lookup messages for such gibberish domains make it difficult to
 detect malicious domain names from DNS logs.
 Recently, DGAs have become more sophisticated.
 Instead of generating random character based domain names, DGAs generate
 domains based on valid dictionary or wordlist based names such as 
\emph on
scoreadmireluckapplyfitcouple.com
\emph default
.
 Wordlist based names are generated by concatenating two or more valid dictionar
y words.
 They make it further challenging to detect and classify the AGDs amongst
 valid or legitimate domain lookup requests.
 Domain blacklisting is usual method to block such domain names.
 However, this method can be easily evaded using sophisticated large wordlist
 based domain names.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Over past decade advances in machine learning, specially in Natural Language
 Processing (NLP) has helped in detecting malicious domain names (AGDs).
 In this paper, we demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning based NLP models
 in detecting malicious domain names as well as predicting the underlying
 algorithm used for generating domain names.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our main contribution, is the proposed design of AGD detection using Bidirection
al Encoder Representational from Transformer (BERT) based method.
 We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of BERT on detecting malicious
 domain names generated using dictionary based real world Domain Generation
 Algorithm(DGA).
 The proposed design outperforms many state of the art methods of malicious
 domain name on detection by more 9 absolute percentage points..

 Yu et al.

proposed a system for inline AGD detection at the DNS server end using Convoluti

 A hybrid neural network approach comprising of parallel CNN and attention
 based Bi-LSTM layers was designed by Yang et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The problem was first converted to binary classification of benign and
 malicious URLs.
 For multiclass classification they were able to obtain an macro averaging
 F1 score of 0.7653 with proposed hybrid architecture.Another similar approach
 utilizing attention based mechanism was proposed by Fangali et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 that uses CNN, Bi-LSTM and Attention layer after the embedding layer to
 do the detection as well as multiclass classification of various DGAs as
 shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 They obtained micro average F1 score of 0.89 and macro average score of
 0.83 on more than 20 real world AGD name list and legitimate domain name
 lists including word list based DGAs such as 
\emph on
matsnu
\emph default
 and 
\emph on

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, the advances in Natural Language Processing has fueled success
 in encountering malicious DGA starting from RNN and leading up to attention
 based deep learning models.
 However, as suggested by Yu et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "yu2018character"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 simpler character embedded models are preferred since more complex RNN,
 LSTM based models are prone to overfitting and simpler models are faster
 to train and test.
 Findings from our own experiments as outlined in this paper also underscore
 the same principle with newer, complex models.

\begin_layout Subsection
Text section heading
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Divide your article into clearly defined and numbered sections.
 Subsections should be numbered as 1.1 (then 1.1.1, 1.1.2, ...), 1.2, etc.
 (the abstract is not included in the section numbering).
 Use this numbering also for internal cross-referencing.
 Any subsection may be given a brief heading.
 Each heading should appear on its own separate line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
References in text
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
References should be obviously related to documents.
 Indicate references by number(s) in square brackets in line with the text.
 The numbered references are listed in the order in which they appear in
 the text.
 The actual authors can be referred to, but the reference number(s) must
 always be given.
 Example: '.....

\begin_layout Standard
Mathematical operation signs indicating continuity of the expression should
 be placed at the left of the second and succeeding lines.
 Use 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 rather than a centered dot, except for scalar products of vectors.
 The solidus (
\begin_inset Formula $\slash$
\end_inset

) should be used instead of built-up fractions in running text.
 Furthermore, the Notation must be legible, clear, compact, and consistent
 with standard usage.
 All unusual symbols whose identity may not be obvious must be identified
 when they first appear, and whenever confusion might arise.
 Superscripts are normally set directly over subscripts; authors should
 note where readability or the meaning requires a special order.
 In the text, numbers should be Arabic numerals, except when beginning a
 sentence.
 Numbers greater than 999 should have commas, e.g., 13,970.
 The 24-hour system is used to indicate time, e.g., 18:00 hr.
